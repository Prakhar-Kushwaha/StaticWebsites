# Projects Structure
### HTML code structure
These themes are responsive layouts with 4+ columns. All of the information within the main content area is nested within a div with a class of "container". And in the blogging and magazine designs, the page split into main side and sidebar. The general template structure is the same throughout all of these templates, each part of the design split from the other parts in a way makes it easy to maintains and update that code.

### CSS files & code structure
I'm using two CSS files in these themes. The first one is a generic reset file. Many devices interpret the default behavior of HTML elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work around this. This file also contains some general styling, such as change colors, font sizes, etc on the small screen. Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file. The second file contains all of the specific stylings for each page.

### Javascript libraries & its use
In these themes, there are some Javascript files import, and all needed files and plugins are included with the project files and these files and plugins are:
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/): jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): Free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
- [Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/): is a library helped me to make sliders in the websites with beautiful transition effects and styles.
- [Parallax](https://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/): is a modern feature, i use this feature to add nicely parallax effects to the layout on mouse scrolling.
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) & [Ion Icons](https://ionic.io/ionicons): Vector icons and social logos to use on the websites. Font Awesome is the web's most popular icon set and toolkit, and it's used by 38% of sites that use third-party font scripts, and the Ion Icons is a premium designed icons for use in web, iOS, Android, and desktop apps. And it's support for SVG and web font.
- [Mixitup](https://www.kunkalabs.com/mixitup-multifilter/docs/get-started/): High-performance, dependency-free library for animated DOM manipulation, giving you the power to filter, sort, add and remove DOM elements with beautiful animations. MixItUp plays nice with your existing HTML and CSS, making it a great choice for responsive layouts and compatible with inline-flow, percentages, media queries, flexbox, and more.
- [TypedJs](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/): a library that types. Enter in any string, and watch it type at the speed you've set, backspace what it's typed, and begin a new sentence for however many strings you've set.
- And finally in ``` main.js ``` file I collect all of above: I implement a few plugins to create the effects in the themes. These plugins is packed, so you won't need to manually edit anything in the file. The only necessary thing to know is how to call the method.
